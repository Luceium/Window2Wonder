# usage

Add streams to `streams.local.json` in the format of

```json
{
  "name": "Yosemite Falls Webcam",
  "url": "https://arc.lib.montana.edu/national-park-service-webcams/item/132",
  "description": "Features one of the tallest waterfalls in North America, with a total height of 2,425 feet. Provides a serene view of cascading water surrounded by pine trees and occasional wildlife like hawks or falcons.",
  "embedding": 0
}
```

Note that 0 is a placeholder and will be replaced before it's uploaded.

Then run `python embed.py` to upload the streams to our db.
